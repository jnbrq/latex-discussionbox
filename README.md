# DiscussionBox for LaTeX

DiscussionBox provides a forum-like typesetting for discussions taking place on LaTeX document sharing platforms like Overleaf. Compared to review mechanisms provided by such platforms, DiscussionBox enables non-volatile and structured conversations, somewhat similar to e-mail.

Check out `tutorial.pdf` and `example.pdf`/`example.tex` for usage.

## Installation

`.sty` file can be installed in your LaTeX distribution. For Overleaf projects, simply copy `tex/`, `tex/discussionbox.sty` and `latexmkrc` files to the project folder.

Once installed, you can do a `\usepackage{discussionbox}`!
